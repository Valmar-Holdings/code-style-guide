## References
### Use Statements
- Use statements should be ordered alphabetically.

### Instantiation
- âœ‹ Where possible, classes should be injected via the constructor, allowing resolution from the CoI. Never user helper methods, or manual resolution via the `app("...")` helper.

### Introspection and Type Casting
- âœ‹ Avoid introspection (checking the type of the class to determine the outcome of a condition).
- âœ‹ Avoid type casting.
- Both imply that logic should be encapsulated or refactored, likely resulting in rearranging or creation of classes.

### Final or Abstract, Never Neither
- Final classes cannot be extended. They are the final version of that class.
- Abstract classes need to be extended, and cannot be used alone.
- âœ‹ Avoid open-ended classes that are neither final nor abstract. Since you control the code, and it is unlikely to be used randomly by anyone else free-standing, and class that is not abstract should by default be final.

### Mutability
- ðŸ¤” Classes should be immutable. If something is changed, they should return a new instance with the changed values. (Does this even make since in a Laravel context? I think this really only comes into play for Value Objects that are not models.)

### Naming
- Name classes after what they are, and not what they do. For example, the following is correct, and the later not so much:

```php
class Name
{
  private $firstName;
  private $lastName;

  function print()
  {
    return "{$this->firstName} {$this->lastName}";
  }
}
```

```php
class NamePrinter
{
  private $firstName;
  private $lastName;

  function print()
  {
    return "{$this->firstName} {$this->lastName}";
  }
}
```

### Contracts (Interfaces)
- Contracts aim to loosen coupling of objects in an application. It is important to remember that coupling is shifted from concrete implementations to abstract contracts (which have no logic, but only specify method interfaces).
- Contracts are not always necessary.
- âœ‹ They should be used with any class that is used in _dependency injection_ or _inversion of control_ containers. This lets us easily switch out implementations, especially in third-party-packages that might require some customization.

### Statics
- Avoid static classes. Classes are intended to be instantiated and be identifiable. Static classes do not have an identity are are not true objects, thus are a stow-away from the procedural era.
- Further, static classes and methods are little more than modern equivalents of `GOTO` statements, procedural in nature. OOP goes beyond that, the object is the defining principle, not the code. Static classes and methods are a crutch used to think procedurally under the guise of seeming object-oriented.

### We want our classes to be declarative, not imperative.**
From wikipedia:
> Declarative programming is a programming paradigmâ€”a style of building the structure and elements of
> computer programsâ€”that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow.
>
> Imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program&#39;s state. > In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative
> program consists of commands for the computer to perform. Imperative programming focuses on describing
> how a program operates.
>
> Static classes consisting of collections of static methods, also known as utility classes, are nothing
> more than a bunch of non-OOP helper methods grouped together.

### Constructors
- âœ‹ Prefer many constructors of many public methods, when possible.
- âœ‹ Use one primary constructor, along with multiple secondary (named) constructors that all make use of the primary constructor.
- âœ‹ Constructors should not include any functionality or logic, but merely assign values to object properties. If logic needs to be performed, this is an indication that the information passed in should actually be another object. The reason behind this is that any code in the constructor will be parsed every time an object is created, regardless if it is necessary or not. That can&#39;t be optimized. Instead of only assignments are handled in constructors, optimization can be controlled, and only the necessary code performed.

### Properties
- âœ‹ Keep classes to fewer than 4 properties where possible (Models are the exception).
- âœ‹ Avoid classes that do not encapsulate any data.
- ðŸ¤” Avoid public properties where possible. Class properties should only be set through constructors and manipulated through methods. (Are getters and settings preferable over public properties -- what dangers are there to consider? What is the underlying reason this is considered such a bad thing?)
- âœ‹ Avoid setting properties to null. (And conversely avoid null-checks.)

### Methods
- âœ‹ Name methods according to what they return. Their names should be self-documenting.
- âœ‹ Methods that perform an action should be a verb, and not return anything.
- âœ‹ Methods that return objects should be nouns and named after the object they return (they can be prefixed with adjectives that help better describe the object being returned).
- âœ‹ Consider method names that are actions, but where an object is returned, like `save()`. In those cases, instead of returning `null`, return the object instance instead.
- âœ‹ Methods should only return one type of data, never mixed.
- âœ‹ Methods should have a declared parameter list, and not use a dynamic one (exceptions exist of course for magic methods).

#### Getters and Setters
- âœ‹ Do not use getters and setters, other than the special methods used in models (`getPropertyAttribute()` and `setPropertyAttribute($value)`).
